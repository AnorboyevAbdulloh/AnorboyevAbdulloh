        <h3>Top 10 Birds in the World</h3>
    </div>
        <div class="wword1">
            <p>Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia. <br><br>

                Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates. <br><br>
                
                Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons.</p>

        <div class="word1">
            <p>Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and comprise the biological family Trochilidae. With about 361 species and 113 genera,[1] they occur from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, but the vast majority of the species are found in the tropics around the equator. They are small birds, with most species measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. The smallest extant hummingbird species is the 5 cm (2.0 in) bee hummingbird, which weighs less than 2.0 g (0.07 oz). The largest hummingbird species is the 23 cm (9.1 in) giant hummingbird, weighing 18–24 grams (0.63–0.85 oz). They are specialized for feeding on flower nectar, but all species also consume flying insects or spiders. <br><br>

                Hummingbirds split from their sister group, the swifts and treeswifts, around 42 million years ago. The common ancestor of extant hummingbirds is estimated to have lived 22 million years ago in South America. They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species to around 80 per second in small hummingbirds. Of those species that have been measured during flying in wind tunnels, their top speeds exceed 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph). During courtship, some male species dive from 30 metres (100 ft) of height above a female at speeds around 23 m/s (83 km/h; 51 mph).</p>

        <div class="wword2">
            <p>The family Paradisaeidae was introduced (as Paradiseidae) in 1825 by the English naturalist William John Swainson as the type genus Paradisaea. For many years, the birds of paradise were treated as close relatives of the wading birds. Today, although both are considered part of the Australasian Corvida lineage, they are currently thought to be only distantly related. The closest evolutionary relatives of the birds of paradise are the crows and jays of the corvidae family, the monarchic flycatchers Monarchidae, and the Australian mud snails Struthideidae. <br><br>

                Birds of paradise are members of the family Paradisaeidae of the order Passeriformes. Most of the species are found in eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and eastern Australia. The family includes 44 species in 17 genera. Members of this family are perhaps best known for the plumage of the males of the species (majority) that are sexually mature, in particular the very long complex feathers extending from the bill, wings, tail or head. For the most part, they live in dense tropical forests. The diet of all species is dominated by fruits and, to a lesser extent, by arthropods. Birds of paradise have many breeding systems, ranging from monogamy to polygamy of the lek type.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="word2">
            <p>Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, even though peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks". <br><br>

                The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual. <br><br>
                
                The functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap theory that these features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</p>

        <div class="wword3">
            <p>Jacanidae is a family ofbirdsinthe order Charadriiformes. It contains eight species in six genera. <br>

                Yakanaceae are aquatic birds and are found intropicalandsubtropicalregions. They live, as a rule, nearlakesand other calmreservoirs. Some species have a growth on the forehead. The legs of the Yakanovs are especially long in relation to the body. Due to the elongated fingers and claws, their weight is distributed over a larger area, which allows them to walk on the leaves floating in the water. Withthe exception of the small yakana, all of them are not very good at flying, but can swim and dive well. The food of yakans consists ofinsects, mollusksand seeds of aquaticplants. <br><br>
                
                Yakan build theirnestsfrom plants that are fragilely stacked on top of each other. Only the male, who is smaller than the female, takes part in the incubation ofeggsand the upbringing of chicks. The female, after laying eggs, tries to attract other males and defends her territory. During the mating season, the female mates with several males. The chicks leave the nest soon after hatching. It happens that the chicks fall from the leaves into the water. Then the father catches them, dries them and heats them under his wing. If danger threatens, the male also hides the chicks under his wings and tries to leave the dangerous place. From under the wings you can see the protruding legs of the chicks. <br><br>

                Eight species of extant jacana are known from six genera and four fossil species have been described from the Oligocene of Egypt  and from the Pliocene of Florida. A fossil from Miocene strata in the Czech Republic was assigned to this family, but more recent analysis disputes the placement and moves the species to the Coraciidae. <br><br>

                Jacanas are identifiable by their elongated toes and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat. They have sharp bills and rounded wings, some with carpal spurs, and many species also have wattles and frontal lappets on their foreheads. Jacanas were once placed in the family Parridae based on the genus Parra but the family name is now Jacanidae based on the type genus Jacana. The family is placed within the order Charadriiformes under the suborder Scolopaci and is a sister of the Rostratulidae. They have 10 tail feathers unlike most others wader groups which have twelve. They have a rudimentary caecum. Most jacanas have five neck vertebrae with the exception of Hydrophasianus chirurgus which has six.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="word3">
            <p>Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls' asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. Although owls have binocular vision, their large eyes are fixed in their sockets—as are those of most other birds—so they must turn their entire heads to change views. As owls are farsighted, they are unable to clearly see anything within a few centimetres of their eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as "feelers". Their far vision, particularly in low light, is exceptionally good. <br><br>

                Owls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270°. Owls have 14 neck vertebrae compared to seven in humans, which makes their necks more flexible. They also have adaptations to their circulatory systems, permitting rotation without cutting off blood to the brain: the foramina in their vertebrae through which the vertebral arteries pass are about 10 times the diameter of the artery, instead of about the same size as the artery as in humans; the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds, giving the vessels some slack, and the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or junction, the largest of any bird's, preventing blood supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks. Other anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect.</p>

            <p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, family Spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.

                They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. <br><br>
                
                The largest living species is the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb). Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>

            <p>Diomedeidae are a family of seabirdsin the orderPetrelidae, widely distributed in theSouthern Ocean (the waters aroundAntarctica) and the NorthPacific Ocean. In the NorthAtlantic, there are none, but on the basisof fossil finds, it can be assumed that they were previously found there. Albatrosses are considered one of the largest flyingbirds, and inthe wandering (Diomedea exulans) andsouthern royal albatrosses (Diomedea epomophora), the wingspan reaches a record high of up to 3.7 m and even higher. Usually all albatrosses are divided into 4 genera, but there are certaindisagreements among ornithologistsabout the number of species. <br><br>

                Birds feel comfortable in the air, skillfully usingdynamicandinclined soaringto overcome significant distances with low energy. They feed onsquid, fish, krill, hunting on the surface of the sea or diving for prey from the air. They breed incolonies, mostly setting up their nests on remote oceanic islands, often in conjunction with other species of birds. Monogamous, pairs between the male and female are formed for quite a long time - over several years, while courtship is accompanied by mating dances; after formation, the vapor persists throughout life. The breeding and nurturing season can last more than a year, starting with the laying of eggs and ending with the first flight of young chicks. There is only oneegg in a clutch.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wword5">
            <p>Ostriches are large flightless birds of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, and kiwis. There are two living species of ostrich: the common ostrich, native to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Somali ostrich, native to the Horn of Africa. The common ostrich was also historically native to the Arabian Peninsula, and ostriches were present across Asia as far east as Mongolia during the Late Pleistocene and possibly into the Holocene. They lay the largest eggs of any living land animal. With the ability to run at 70 km/h (43.5 mph), they are the fastest birds on land. They are farmed worldwide, particularly for their feathers as they are used as decoration and feather dusters. Their skin is also used for leather products. They are the heaviest living birds. <br><br>

                The earliest fossils of the genus Struthio are from the early Miocene ~21 million years ago of Namibia in Africa, so it is proposed that genus is of African origin. By the middle to late Miocene (5–13 mya) they had spread to and become widespread across Eurasia.[6] While the relationship of the African fossil species is comparatively straightforward, many Asian species of ostrich have been described from fragmentary remains, and their interrelationships and how they relate to the African ostriches are confusing. In India, Mongolia and China, ostriches are known to have become extinct only around, or even after, the end of the last ice age; images of ostriches have been found prehistoric Chinese pottery and petroglyphs.</p>

            <p>Swifts, ortrue swifts, orswifts (Latin: Apodidae), are a familyof birds inthe order Swifts. They are characterized by a dense streamlined body, long saber-shapedwings, a flattened head with a short flat beak and short weak legs. Paintedwith a predominance of black or gray tones, the ventral side is usually lighter. There is no sexual dimorphism. Swifts are distributed everywhere except in the northern and southern polar regions, most ofAustralia, some oceanic islands and the central parts ofthe SaharaandTibet. <br><br>

                The tenth edition of The System of Nature (1758) included four species of swifts; Carl Linnaeusreferred to them asswallows, a bit like swifts in flight. Currently, it is generally recognized to distinguish two subfamilies of swifts - CypseloidinaeandApodinae, including 113 species in 19 genera. Many scientists divide the subfamily Apodinae into threetribes: salangans (Collocaliini), spinytails [no] (Chaeturini) andtypical swifts [no] (Apodini). The most primitive group of swifts is theNew World-boundCypseloidinae, followed by Collocaliini and Chaeturini, and the most evolutionaryly advanced is the Apodini group.</p>
